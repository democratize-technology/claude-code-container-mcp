## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions and classes
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on edge cases

### Integration Tests
- Test Docker interactions
- Verify MCP protocol compliance
- Ensure proper error handling

### E2E Tests
- Test complete workflows
- Verify multi-session scenarios
- Test AWS Bedrock integration

## Docker Image Guidelines

When modifying the Docker setup:

1. Minimize image size
2. Use multi-stage builds
3. Pin dependency versions
4. Follow security best practices
5. Document any new environment variables

## Security Considerations

Given the sensitive nature of Docker access:

1. Never bypass security checks
2. Validate all inputs thoroughly
3. Follow principle of least privilege
4. Document security implications
5. Consider attack vectors in code reviews
